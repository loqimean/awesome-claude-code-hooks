# Awesome Claude Code Hooks [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of hooks, guides, tools, and examples for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) hooks — the shell-command lifecycle events that let you intercept, block, log, or augment what your coding agent does.

Claude Code hooks fire on events like `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `Notification`, `Stop`, and `UserPromptSubmit`, running arbitrary shell commands with structured JSON in/out. This list collects the best real-world implementations, so you don't have to write your security guardrail or notification hook from scratch.

## Security & Guardrail Hooks

Hooks that block destructive commands, exfiltration attempts, or unsafe file access before they execute.

- [DataFog/datafog-python](https://github.com/DataFog/datafog-python) — `datafog-hook` gates tool calls (shell commands, web requests, file writes, MCP tools) and blocks PII from leaving the machine, entirely offline in ~70-90ms.
- [dwarvesf/claude-guardrails](https://github.com/dwarvesf/claude-guardrails) — hardened Claude Code security config with permission deny rules, shell hooks, and prompt-injection defense in full and lite variants.
- [hahahahahahahahah6/agent-guard](https://github.com/hahahahahahahahah6/agent-guard) — dependency-free guard stack that blocks the "green by editing the test" cheat (snapshots test/source hashes, blocks `Stop` until a changed test is proven to fail without the fix), plus an outbound-action denylist for pushes, publishes, deploys, and mass-send channels, with mutation-testing and comment-slop checks on top.
- [hanlulong/overleaf-sync-now](https://github.com/hanlulong/overleaf-sync-now) — `PreToolUse` hook that pulls fresh Overleaf web edits before every `.tex`/`.bib` read or write, stopping the agent from silently overwriting them with a stale local Dropbox copy.
- [JeongJaeSoon/agent-guard](https://github.com/JeongJaeSoon/agent-guard) — `PreToolUse` guardrail that blocks an agent from reading `.env` files or writing secret-like values, using gitleaks for detection, with matching Git hook and CI backstops.
- [kaboumou/agent-run-guard](https://github.com/kaboumou/agent-run-guard) — dependency-free hook CLI for repeat-call and call-budget limits, with a documented Claude Code adapter (simulated hook tests; fails open on internal errors).
- [kenryu42/cc-safety-net](https://github.com/kenryu42/cc-safety-net) — `PreToolUse` guardrail hook blocking destructive git/filesystem commands and secret file access; also supports Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other agent runtimes.
- [kornysietsma/tool-gate-hook](https://github.com/kornysietsma/tool-gate-hook) — `PreToolUse` hook for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI that auto-allows, auto-denies, or forces a prompt on tool calls via TOML rules, and logs every decision (payload, matched rules, outcome) to a JSONL audit trail. Rename/rework of the old `claude-code-permissions-hook`.
- [li-zhixin/claude-ignore](https://github.com/li-zhixin/claude-ignore) — `PreToolUse` hook that blocks Claude from reading files matching `.claudeignore` patterns, mirroring `.gitignore` semantics.
- [liberzon/claude-hooks](https://github.com/liberzon/claude-hooks) — `PreToolUse` hook that decomposes compound bash commands and checks each sub-command individually against allow/deny permission patterns.

- [tillmeier/claude-code-guardrails](https://github.com/tillmeier/claude-code-guardrails) — guardrail hooks derived from real incidents, paired with a plan→implement→verify→crosscheck loop, backed by 35 bats tests and measured hook overhead.
- [ulukaya/pawl](https://github.com/ulukaya/pawl) — deterministic `PreToolUse`/`Stop` gates for Claude Code, Codex and Antigravity that refuse home/root deletions (following scripts, Makefiles and `npm run`), ask before destructive git and credential reads, block token egress, and auto-approve provably read-only commands; stdlib Python, no network.
- [wangbooth/Claude-Code-Guardrails](https://github.com/wangbooth/Claude-Code-Guardrails) — protective hooks preventing accidental code loss via branch protection, automatic checkpointing, and safe commit squashing.
- [randommonicle/claude-skills](https://github.com/randommonicle/claude-skills) — a four-layer architecture of guardrail hooks and norms distilled from real shipped defects across four production codebases.
- [yurukusa/cc-safe-setup](https://github.com/yurukusa/cc-safe-setup) — interactive installer for `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`SessionStart`/`Stop`/`SubagentStop` hooks that block destructive commands (`rm -rf`, force-push, `git reset --hard`, secret writes) at the tool boundary, with plugin variants for git protection, credential guarding, and token budgets.

## Notification Hooks

Send a ping to Slack, Telegram, desktop notification center, etc. when Claude needs input or finishes a task.

## Observability & Logging Hooks

- [hansipie/ecotokens](https://github.com/hansipie/ecotokens) — `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks filter and compress shell output, file reads, and grep results before they hit the model, with a TUI dashboard tracking token savings per project.

## Git & Commit Hooks

- [blader/taskmaster](https://github.com/blader/taskmaster) — `Stop` hook that keeps the agent working until all plan items and user requests are fully complete, rather than stopping early.
- [malaysherasia-ai/claude-never-again](https://github.com/malaysherasia-ai/claude-never-again) — turns each bug you fix into a `PreToolUse` hook on `git commit` that blocks the mistake (warn first, then deny after five correct fires), also run from git’s own pre-commit; the rest become one capped line in LESSONS.md.
- [parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3](https://github.com/parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3) — hooks maintain ledgers/handoffs for context continuity across sessions and commits.

## Formatting / Linting / Testing Gates

- [vshulcz/deja-vu](https://github.com/vshulcz/deja-vu) — single Go binary that indexes session history already on disk across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and 35+ other agents, surfacing matching past fixes via local search, MCP, and hooks with no LLM in the loop.
- [entireio/cli](https://github.com/entireio/cli) — installs `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks that capture full agent sessions (prompts, files touched, tool calls) into a separate git branch, indexed and searchable alongside your commit history.
- [mksglu/context-mode](https://github.com/mksglu/context-mode) — hooks that compress tool output to save context window space and persist session memory.
